### What is Savoury Searches?
- Savoury Searches is a web-app solution for the foodie-peoples who loves food and also love to explore new food. It is basically an app which locates the best street foods stalls and outlets across the city üòçüôå.
- Many of us love eating outside and tasty street foods are the favourites for many. So we built a one-stop platform to explore the famous street foods, which will not only help the users to explore more but also the small business owners and stall owners to make a bigger audience and earn more while doing what they do.
- We promote only small food stalls like Momos wale, Tea Corners, etc. which are not capable to make thier online presence on food-delievery apps like Zomato and Swiggy. 
- Its a website where the normal users can share their reviews about a stall or shop, rate them and even can suggest the team to add one of their favourite stalls in their locality or so.



### Why we built this?
We are a college students and we oftenly eat outside and the street food is our first place to visit as we cannot afford that expensive food. We always explore to find new places with tasty food stalls and street food like recently a friend of us suggested to visit the Raju Soft Corner who makes delicious Dosa and Idli that too in Rs. 50 per plate. 

But what if someone living there not have such a good friend and never explored the fabulous taste that was located nearby. So we came up with the idea to make a web-app based on this where someone who has explored some good foods can share their review and also add their favourite stall which will now be visible for everyone. And others can now view that stall in the map section and explore the stall and ahve amazing foodüòä!

### How we BUILT this?
Features:
- [ ] Auth0 login/signup with custom actions deployed 
- [ ] MAPBOX: map feature to locate nearby stalls and outlets
- [ ] AWS S3 bucket to store video content posted by users
- [ ] Add a new stall 
- [ ] Add images of the stalls and foods 
- [ ] Accurate location using location picker built with MAPBOX 
- [ ] Add reviews in stall page
- [ ] Rate the stalls 
- [ ] Report the fake stalls
- [ ] Follow/unfollow users
- [ ] Add reactions to the content

### Challenges that we faced?
We used MAPBOX api's to build the map component to display the stall locations from our custom dataset. Also to locate the nearby stall locations we had to fetch the user live geolocation which was very challenging in itself. Then to calculate the distance between users location and the stall we had to write a unique function.

We had to take the real images from user about the stall and post where we had to use cloudinary to upload the image and then save the url of the asset in the database which was very new to us. Apart from that using AWS S3 bucket to store the reels and generate a accessble link of the video uploaded, We faced many errors while doing so
